# SearchViewBottomNav

This repo is an exercise in developing a SearchView based search facility
in combination with a Bottom Navigation bar.

Code credits:

* Android Studio Bottom Navigation Bar template

It is coded in Kotlin and is based on the `BottomNavigationBar` "Hello World" template
as kindly provided in Android Studio 4.1.

* Wikipedia android application

The User Interface development is targeted at the affordances provided by the Android *Wikipedia*
application.   The Wikipedia application source code can be found at the following URL:
[https://github.com/wikimedia/apps-android-wikipedia]


The design follows what exists in the Wikipedia app as of October 2020.

* Cheesesquare

The design also borrows from the `https://github.com/chrisbanes/cheesesquare` repo
authored by @chrisbanes.

* Material components android examples "Reply" - the `type.xml` file less the font definitions and color folder
were pulled in as-is.
