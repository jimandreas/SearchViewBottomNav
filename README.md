# SearchViewBottomNav

repo: https://github.com/jimandreas/SearchViewBottomNav

This repo was doing to develope a SearchView based search facility.
**_BUT_** It has now pivoted to developing search functionality 
using an EditText widget.   The demonstration app is composed 
using a [bottom navigation] bar as the User Interface (UI) framework. 

Code credits:

* Android Studio Bottom Navigation Bar template

It is coded in Kotlin and is based on the `BottomNavigationBar` "Hello World" template
as kindly provided in Android Studio 4.1.

* [wikipedia app in github]

The UI in the Wikipedia app switches dynamically between a history of
the search function, and a dynamically updated match list based on the 
search entry text.  The design follows what exists in the Wikipedia app 
as of October 2020.

The design also the collapsing toolbar view for the fruit activity.  The link above

* [Reply material components android example]

The **Reply** sample application has a mostly non-functional search function - 
but the UI is based on the EditText widget rather than the SearchView
widget.   The EditText widget provides a sufficient level of 
base functionality and proved to be much simpler to manage 
in laying out UI components.   This sample app wires up the "cancel text" X
pushbutton, and the back arrow to dismiss the soft keyboard in a layout similar to
the **Reply** app.
