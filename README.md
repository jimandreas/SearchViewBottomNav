# SearchViewBottomNav

This repo is an exercise in developing a SearchView based search facility
in combination with a Bottom Navigation bar.

It is coded in Kotlin and is based on the BottomNavigationBar "Hello World" template
as kindly provided in Android Studio 4.1.

The User Interface development is targeted at the affordances provided by the Android Wikipedia
application.   The Wikipedia application source code can be found at the following link:

https://github.com/wikimedia/apps-android-wikipedia

The design follows what exists in the Wikipedia app as of October 2020.
